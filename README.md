# Ramay Humour Academy

A comprehensive platform for comedy and soft skills education, featuring curriculum management, faculty coordination, and student enrollment systems.

## About the Project

**Ramay Humour Academy** is an educational platform designed to teach comedic principles as trainable mechanics. The platform transforms intangible qualities like charisma, wit, and presence into structured, teachable skills through:

- **4 Core Programs**: Emotional Intelligence & Wit, Public Speaking & Presence, Adaptive Leadership, Advanced Satire & Strategy
- **Module-Based Learning**: Each program consists of multiple phases taught by certified faculty
- **Cohort Management**: Flexible scheduling with capacity management and enrollment tracking
- **Role-Based Access**: Board of Directors (BOD), Faculty/Architects, and Students with distinct dashboards

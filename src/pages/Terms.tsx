            <p>
                By accessing or using the Ramay Institute of Humour website and services, you agree to be
                bound by these Terms.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Acceptance</h3>
            <p>
                If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our services. But honestly, they are
                pretty standard properly.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Student Code of Conduct</h3>
            <p>
                We demand a culture of psychological safety. We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment,
                hate speech, or malicious punching-down. Comedy is about connection, not exclusion.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>
                The curriculum, materials, and methodology of Ramay Academy are the intellectual property of
                the Institute.
